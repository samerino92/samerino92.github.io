		<h1>Bio</h1>
			<p>
			Sam Neufeld is a native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A recent graduate of The New School, he currently lives in Miami studying Jazz Performance at University of Miami - The Frost School of Music. At the early age of 14, he was accepted into the top Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra jazz combo as the youngest student. With this group, he played at the 2006 New York JVC Jazz Festival. Several years later in 2009, Sam was invited to play at Carnegie Hall with the Brookfield High School Orchestra. Early in 2010, he was chosen out from hundreds across the nation for the Jazz Band of America. He and seventeen other high school students played at the Music for All festival with renowned trumpeter Wayne Bergeron. Sam was chosen again for a similar program called The Next Generation Jazz Orchestra (NGJO) in the summer of 2010. The NGJO toured Canada, playing at Rexâ€™s Jazz Club, The Toronto Jazz Festival, The Montreal Jazz Festival, and The Jazz Standard in New York. The group rejoined in the fall to perform with special guest Diane Reeves at The Monterey Jazz Festival. Other performance venues have included The Telluride Jazz Festival with the Telluride Jazz All-stars, Millennium Park in Chicago, The Third Ward Jazz Festival, Joe's Pub, The Velvet Lounge, and The Jazz Estate. Through other various educational programs and camps, Sam has had the chance to work and/or play with such jazz notables as Joshua Redman, Jimmy Heath, Carl Allen, Bobby Shew, Dominick Farinacci and more. He has studied privately with Jamie Breiwick, Mark Niehaus, and Philip Dizack.

			<br>
			Sam currently studies under the tutelage of trumpeter Brian Lynch at University of Miami. He is a member of two of the top ensembles - Concert Jazz Band (CJB) and Frost Sextet. Both groups work and perform continuously with many great guest artists: Kate Reid, John Fedchock, David Binney, and others. 
			<br>
			<br>
			At the New School, Sam has had the opportunity to work with many great teachers and private instructors. Improvisation ensemble directors have included bassist Reggie Workman, drummer Andrew Cyrille, and tenor saxophonist Billy Harper. Private instructors have included drummer Gerald Cleaver, guitarists Julian Lage and Miles Okazaki, pianist Aaron Parks, and trumpeters Jimmy Owens, Ambrose Akinmusire, Marcus Printup, and Avishai Cohen.
