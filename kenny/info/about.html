        <p class="quote"><i>“[Sara and Kenny] were able to bond over their mutual admiration for each other's jazz and classical guitar skills. And music, after all, is a universal language.”</i><br><br></p>
        
        <p><span style="color: #fcf9b6;">Sara</span> and <span style="color: #fcf9b6;">Kenny</span> met in Milwaukee, WI (USA), through a shared love of the growing improvised music scene. They immediately connected and started working on original music in July 2015. An eclectic blend of voice, ukulele, nylon and steel string guitars, Sara and Kenny embrace their wide range of musical styles to create their intimate sound.<br><br>

            The duo’s debut album, <span style="color: #fcf9b6;">“Spirit of Gold”</span> was released in October 2015, to rave reviews and a sold out show at the historic Villa Terrace Decorative Arts Museum in Milwaukee. Piet Levy of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said, “It’s striking how simpatico Sara and Kenny sound…especially considering their backgrounds couldn’t be more different. From Reichert's bright, flighty guitar work on "Four Minutes" to d'Ippolito's rich vocals during a romantic cover of Luigi Tenco's "Ti Ricorderai," "Spirit of Gold" will leave you smitten.” The songs are simple and yet sophisticated, melodic and elegant all at once. <br><br>

            <span style="color: #fcf9b6;">Sara’s</span> Story: <br>
            Born into a multicultural and musical family, Sara grew up in Southern Italy where she was exposed early to a variety of musical genres and expressions.<br><br>

            She began writing her own music from an early age, even before she began her training in classical guitar. While obtaining her degree at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory of Rome, Italy, she continued cultivating her love for songwriting and all types of musical genres by playing and singing in a variety of groups and ensembles.<br><br>

            She moved to the USA in 2010. Since then she has been continuing to grow musically by teaching and performing both as a solo artist and with other musicians, until she met Kenny.<br><br>

            <span style="color: #fcf9b6;">Kenny’s</span> Story: <br>
            A native of Brookfield, Wisconsin, Kenny began his study of classical piano at age five and guitar at age twelve. He began his early jazz studies with local guitar veteran Roger Brotherhood. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra Jazz Studies and also attended the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music. During his high school years Kenny won various outstanding soloist awards, including “Best Class A Soloist” at the prestigious Eau Claire Jazz Festival.<br><br>

Kenny attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. He then returned to Milwaukee and finished his degree in Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee while performing actively around the city. Then in January 2015, completely by chance, Kenny met Sara.<br><br>
